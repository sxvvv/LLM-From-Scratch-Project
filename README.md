# LLM Practical Learning Journey ðŸš€
â€‹â€‹"Buff-Stacked but Unstoppable" Editionâ€‹â€‹

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a Class of 2026 female developer diving into LLMs from scratch. Yes, the odds feel stacked, but we're turning those buffs into superpowers!

## ðŸŒ± Current Status
  - Absolute beginner in LLMs 
  - Building this repo brick by brick
  - Documenting every stumble and breakthrough

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
Understand LLM fundamentals through hands-on projects
Build small functional models
Contribute meaningfully to OSS LLM projects by graduation

## ðŸ’ª Motivation Mantra
"They say 'too many buffs' - I say 'more data points!' Every perceived disadvantage is just another feature to engineer around."
